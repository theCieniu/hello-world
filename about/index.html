  <h2>My goal and future plans</h2>
  <p>
    I've started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make my blogging more
    professional and I've felt in love with coding. I worked as a biotechnologis
    but I needed a new direction and programming seems to be a perfect choice
    for me. Now I'm focused on learning new skills and it's an amazing journey!
    My dream job is to join biotechnology knowledge and programming skills.
