# hello-world
My first repository to get familiar with GitHub. 
I added here my very first written from scratch HTML page. I treat this one as my coding playground to test and practice newly learnt features. This approach may make the code chaotic. But I'm aware of that and in this particular case I accept it somehow, because this doucment isn't suppoused to be designed and built with any plan. I just spontaniously add few lines of code every time I need to practice something. It's not meant to be my portfolio, it's my safe space to test new things. Thank you for your patience, every advise and helpful tips would be welcome with grattitude. Have a nice day!
